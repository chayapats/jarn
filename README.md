**J.A.R.N. — Just A Reliable Nerd**

A TUI-first coding agent harness built on [DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents).

</div>

---

J.A.R.N. is a terminal coding agent in the spirit of Claude Code and Codex CLI, but
built as its own opinionated harness on top of the DeepAgents library. Its defining
trait is **reliability**: it plans before acting, verifies its own work, asks before
doing anything risky, and never claims success on a guess.

It runs entirely in your terminal (a Web UI is on the roadmap, post-launch).

> **Status:** v0.1.0 **alpha** on PyPI. The architecture, configuration, permission
> engine, and terminal REPL are implemented and tested; live model calls require
> your own API key. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

> **Security:** J.A.R.N. runs tools on your **host** by default (real filesystem +
> shell). A project's `.jarn/config.yaml` can declare hooks, MCP servers, and
> provider overrides — only trust repositories you would run code from. Untrusted
> projects are gated until you approve (`jarn trust`). Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
> before use.

## Why J.A.R.N.?

- **Reliable by design** — plan → act → verify is baked into the system prompt, with
  a self-verification loop that runs your project's build/test/lint before reporting done.
- **Safe by default** — a multi-layer permission system (coarse modes + fine-grained
  rules) sits in front of every file write and shell command, backed by a hard
  *danger-guard* that always confirms catastrophic actions — even in YOLO mode.
- **Bring your own model** — 13 providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
  Mistral, Groq, DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, xAI, Ollama, LM Studio, plus a generic
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint) with per-task routing so subagents can use cheaper models.
- **Cost-aware** — live token/cost tracking with a per-session budget that can warn
  or hard-stop.
- **Extensible** — skills, slash commands, custom subagents, lifecycle hooks, and MCP
  servers, all configured through plain files in `~/.jarn` and `.jarn/`.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+** and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). macOS and Linux are
supported (Windows via WSL).

```bash
pip install jarn            # PyPI (alpha)
# or: uv tool install jarn

# from source:
git clone https://github.com/chayapats/jarn && cd jarn
uv sync --extra dev
uv run jarn
```

`uv.lock` is tracked in the repo so every teammate gets the same dependency versions.

### Sharing with your team

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd jarn
uv sync --extra dev
uv run jarn setup          # once per machine — stores API key in ~/.jarn
cd your-project
jarn doctor                # config, providers, and loaded extensions
jarn                       # trust prompt appears if the project declares hooks/MCP
jarn trust .               # pre-approve a repo you control (optional)
```

If a cloned project ships `.jarn/config.yaml` with hooks, MCP servers, or provider
overrides, J.A.R.N. asks before honouring them. Decline to run safely with those
settings stripped, or run `jarn trust <path>` after reviewing the repo. Use
`jarn doctor` to see which skills, commands, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers
would load (including shadowed or skipped files).

## Quick start

```bash
jarn setup        # first-run wizard: pick a provider, store your API key, choose defaults
cd your-project
jarn init         # create a JARN.md project-context file (optional but recommended)
jarn              # launch the TUI
jarn doctor       # diagnose config / providers / keys / extensions at any time
```

On first launch with no config, J.A.R.N. runs the setup wizard automatically.

## The interface: native inline

```bash
jarn            # start a session
jarn --resume   # pick a previous session to resume on launch
```

J.A.R.N. renders the conversation straight to your terminal's normal buffer —
no alternate screen. The whole transcript lives in your terminal's **native
scrollback**: one scroll gesture scrolls everything and native selection/copy
works across the entire history, exactly like Claude Code. Assistant replies
stream live and render as Markdown; tool calls, approvals, and a per-turn diff
preview appear inline.

## Using J.A.R.N.

```
┌ toolbar: model · mode · queue · ctx · cost ─────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                            │
│   conversation stream (assistant output, tool calls, approvals)           │
│                                                                            │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ › your message…                                                          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Type** a message and press **Enter** to send (**Shift+Enter** / **Ctrl+J** for a newline).
- Start a line with **`/`** for a command (see below). **`@`** references a file path.
- **↑ / ↓** navigate input history.
- **Tab** accepts the highlighted completion (`/command` or `@file`).
- **Shift+Tab** cycles the permission mode (plan → ask → auto-edit → yolo); the new
  mode flashes on the input border and stays in the status bar.
- **Ctrl+O** (or **`/expand`**) opens the last turn's full tool output in the pager.
- **Esc** cancels the running turn. **Ctrl+C** cancels a turn / clears the input,
  and **twice in a row** exits (Claude Code-style). **Ctrl+Q** also quits.
- **Copy text:** the terminal owns selection — just **drag to select and ⌘C**
  (or your terminal's copy), and scroll with your terminal's native scrollback,
  exactly like Claude Code.

Assistant replies render as **Markdown** (headings, lists, syntax-highlighted code).

`/model`, `/mode`, and `/resume` with no argument open an **arrow-key picker**
(↑/↓ + Enter; Esc cancel). `/model` also offers a custom ref prompt.

While a turn is running, submitted lines are **queued** (shown in the toolbar as
`queue N`); manage them with `/queue`, `/queue clear`, `/queue cancel <n>`, or
`/queue move <from> <to>`.

### Built-in commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show available commands and shortcuts. |
| `/init` | Create a JARN.md project context file. |
| `/model [/ref]` | Show or switch the active model. |
| `/mode [plan\|ask\|auto-edit\|yolo]` | Show or switch the permission mode (plan/ask/auto-edit/yolo). |
| `/sandbox [on\|off]` | Show or toggle the execution backend (local/sandbox). |
| `/cost` | Show session token usage and cost. |
| `/compact` | Summarize and compact the conversation context. |
| `/expand` | Open the last turn's full tool output in the pager (same as Ctrl+O). |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation and start a fresh thread. |
| `/sessions` | List and resume previous sessions. |
| `/resume` | Pick a previous session to resume. |
| `/skills` | List available skills. |
| `/memory [search\|show\|add\|update\|delete] ...` | List, search, show, add, update, or delete long-term memory. |
| `/permissions` | Show current permission rules and allowlist. |
| `/queue [clear\|cancel <n>\|move <from> <to>]` | Show or manage queued input lines (while a turn is running). |
| `/quit` | Exit J.A.R.N. |

## Permission modes

| Mode | File reads | File writes | Shell | Network |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plan` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `ask` (default) | ✅ | ask | ask | ask |
| `auto-edit` | ✅ | ✅ in-scope | ask | ✅ *(read-only)* |
| `yolo` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

The **danger-guard** overrides all modes: `rm -rf` (incl. `rm -r -f` / `--recursive
--force`), force-push, `git reset --hard`, `mkfs`, fork bombs, out-of-scope writes, etc.
always require explicit confirmation (or are blocked outright). **Esc/Ctrl+C** cancels a
turn *and* kills any shell it spawned. See [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md).

**Untrusted repos:** a project's `.jarn/config.yaml` can declare hooks, MCP servers, and
providers — capabilities that can run code or read secrets. J.A.R.N. asks you to **trust
a project** before honoring those keys (once per repo); decline and they're ignored while
the session continues safely.

## Configuration

Two tiers, both YAML, merged together (project overrides global):

```
~/.jarn/config.yaml      global: providers, keys (by reference), defaults, budget
.jarn/config.yaml        per-project: MCP servers, hooks, permission rules (committed)
JARN.md                  per-project context, auto-loaded into the system prompt
```

API keys are **referenced, never inlined** — `${ENV_VAR}` or `keychain:jarn/<provider>`.
Project config is gated by a **trust prompt** (see above). See
[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for the full reference.

## Extending

Drop files into `~/.jarn/{skills,commands,agents}` (global) or `.jarn/{...}` (project):

- **Skills** (`skills/*.md`) — reusable knowledge/workflows, auto- or manually-triggered.
- **Commands** (`commands/*.md`) — custom `/slash` prompt templates.
- **Subagents** (`agents/*.md`) — specialist agents the main loop can delegate to.
- **Hooks** (config) — shell commands run on lifecycle events (lint after edit, test before commit).
- **MCP servers** (config) — connect external tool servers (stdio or HTTP).

See [docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md) ([quick start](docs/EXTENDING.md#quick-start-wire-skill--hook--mcp)) and [examples/](examples/).
