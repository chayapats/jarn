## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not** open public GitHub issues for security bugs.

Email the maintainer with:

- Description and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected version (`jarn --version`)
- Optional patch or PoC

We aim to acknowledge within **72 hours** and share a fix timeline when confirmed.

## Threat model (read this before running J.A.R.N.)

J.A.R.N. is a **local coding agent**. It can read/write files and run shell commands
in your project directory when you approve them (or automatically in permissive modes).

### Default posture

- **Host execution:** unless a sandbox runtime is configured and available, tools run
  on your machine with your user privileges. Safety is enforced by the permission
  engine and danger-guard, not by kernel isolation.
- **Permission modes:** default is **ask** — mutating actions prompt for approval.
  `yolo` disables prompts but **not** the hard danger-guard (e.g. `rm -rf /`).
- **Project trust:** a project's `.jarn/config.yaml` can declare hooks, MCP servers,
  provider overrides, and other capability keys. **Untrusted projects** have those keys
  stripped until you approve (`Trust this project's config?` or `jarn trust <path>`).
- **Secrets:** API keys live in `~/.jarn/config.yaml` or your OS keychain. Project
  config can reference `${ENV}` — only trust projects you would run code from.
  Inline plaintext keys in `config.yaml` are discouraged: the loader emits an
  `InlineSecretWarning` for any literal that looks like a real key, and rejects
  it outright when `strict_secrets: true` (recommended for CI / shared hosts).
  Prefer `keychain:jarn/<provider>`, `file:jarn/<provider>`, or `${ENV_VAR}`.
- **`JARN_HOME` override:** Global state (config, secrets, trust store, sessions) lives
  under `~/.jarn` by default. Setting `JARN_HOME` redirects all of that to another
  directory. A hijacked environment — a CI job, a shared shell, or instructions in an
  untrusted repo telling you to `export JARN_HOME=…` — can point secrets and trust
  decisions at an attacker-controlled path. Only set `JARN_HOME` in environments you
  control; `jarn doctor` warns when it is non-default.
- **Network:** `web_fetch` / `web_search` and MCP tools are gated through the permission
  engine. `web_fetch` blocks private/loopback/metadata addresses by default.
- **Pluggable search provider API keys:** `web_search` can be configured to use
  Tavily, Brave Search, or Exa instead of the keyless DuckDuckGo scraper.  Keys are
  always resolved through the existing secret-reference resolver (`${ENV_VAR}`,
  `keychain:jarn/<provider>`, `file:jarn/<provider>`) — inline literals are never
  accepted.  Resolved key values are never included in tool output strings.  The
  following HTTPS hosts are contacted only by the named provider clients (NOT through
  the `web_fetch` SSRF guard — they are fixed trusted API hosts, not user-supplied URLs):
    - `api.tavily.com`              — Tavily Search API
    - `api.search.brave.com`        — Brave Search API
    - `api.exa.ai`                  — Exa Search API
    - `html.duckduckgo.com`         — DuckDuckGo HTML scraper (SSRF-guarded, keyless fallback)
- **`@git:` mentions:** the four supported subcommands (`status`, `diff`, `staged`,
  `log`) run via a fixed, read-only argv allowlist (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`,
  `git diff`, `git diff --staged`, `git log --oneline -15`).  The subprocess is called
  directly — **no shell interpolation**, no user-controlled arguments.  All output is
  passed through `redact_secrets` before injection.  Unknown subcommands are left
  verbatim; git errors produce an error block rather than exposing raw exceptions.
- **`@url:` mentions:** rewritten to a `web_fetch` instruction at submit time — **no
  pre-fetch occurs** in the REPL.  The agent's gated `web_fetch` tool (subject to the
  permission engine and SSRF guard) performs the actual network request.

### Filesystem write scope (`--add-dir` multi-root)

The agent's write scope is bounded to a set of **roots** (the primary project root
first, plus any added with `jarn --add-dir <dir>` at launch or `/add-dir <path>`
mid-session). A write is in-scope only when it resolves under one of these roots; an
out-of-scope write is downgraded to *ask* (never silently allowed) and flagged
dangerous.

- **Per-root symlink discipline.** Each root's containment check follows symlinks
  (`Path.resolve()`), so a symlink placed *inside* an added root that points *outside*
  every root resolves out-of-scope and is rejected — the same escape defense that
  protects the primary root protects every added root. Relative write targets are
  anchored to the **primary** root, not the process CWD, so `../outside` is judged by
  intent.
- **One roots set, three enforcement points.** The engine's intent check, the local
  backend's virtual-mode filesystem guard, the OS sandbox (`sandbox-exec` / `bwrap`)
  writable allow-set, and the Docker bind mounts are all driven from the **same** roots
  set. An added-root write the engine allows is therefore also permitted at syscall
  time (no silent block), and a write outside all roots is denied at every layer
  (defense in depth against the TOCTOU window).
- **`/add-dir` is capability-gated.** Mid-session it requires explicit approval in
  `ask` mode and is **refused outright on an untrusted project** — a scope-widening
  capability is never granted to a repo whose config you have not trusted.
- **Checkpoint is primary-root only (a real limitation).** Auto-checkpoints, and thus
  `/undo` and `/rewind` file restore, snapshot the **primary project root only**. Edits
  the agent makes inside an **added** root are **not captured** and cannot be reverted
  through jarn — use your own VCS in those directories. `/add-dir` prints this warning
  when it adds a root. Project context (`JARN.md`) is likewise loaded from the primary
  root only.

### What we do not guarantee in v0.4 alpha

- Complete protection against a malicious **trusted** project (you approved its config)
- Sandbox isolation without an external sandbox provider
- Protection against prompt injection leading to social-engineered approvals —
  review approval prompts carefully

### The danger-guard is a net, not a sandbox

The danger-guard (`src/jarn/permissions/guard.py`) inspects the **pre-shell command
string** with patterns before the permission engine decides whether to run it. It
catches the common catastrophic shapes (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, force-push, pipe-to-shell,
privileged containers, package-manager postinstalls, mass working-tree discards, …)
and applies NFKC + best-effort homoglyph normalization so a disguised verb like
Cyrillic `rm` is still matched.

It does **not** parse shell syntax. A payload can be hidden from these patterns by
chaining through an interpreter — `eval`, `bash -c`, `python -c`, heredoc bodies,
`$(printf …)`, or a `base64 -d | sh` indirection the net doesn't recognise. The guard
is a defense-in-depth **net**; for code you do not trust, run it with
`execution.backend: docker` or the OS sandbox (`execution.local_sandbox: require`),
not on the host in `yolo`. We do not claim the pattern set is complete.

## Hardening checklist for operators

1. Run `jarn doctor` after cloning an unfamiliar repository.
2. Decline the trust prompt until you have reviewed `.jarn/config.yaml` and hooks.
3. Stay in `ask` or `plan` mode for untrusted codebases.
4. Set `execution.allow_local_fallback: false` if you require sandbox-or-nothing.
5. Keep `~/.jarn` permissions tight (`chmod 700 ~/.jarn`).

## Dependency security

Runtime dependencies are pinned in `uv.lock` for development. PyPI installs resolve
from `pyproject.toml` ranges. Report supply-chain concerns through the same private
channel above.
