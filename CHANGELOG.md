## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/theme` command + terminal background auto-detection (T-2-10)** — new
  `/theme [dark|light|high-contrast|auto]` command: bare `/theme` opens an
  arrow-key picker (↑/↓ + Enter; Esc cancel) showing the four options with the
  currently-resolved theme in the header; `/theme <name>` applies directly.
  Applying re-runs `palette.configure_ui` at runtime (toolbar/live region pick
  up new colours immediately; already-committed scrollback stays as-is) and
  persists `ui.theme` via the standard config-set path.
  New `ui.theme: auto` value — resolves at startup via an OSC-11 terminal
  background probe (`\x1b]11;?\x07`): reads the reply in raw mode with a hard
  100 ms deadline, computes sRGB relative luminance, classifies as `light` or
  `dark`; falls back to `dark` when stdin/stdout are not a tty (pipes, CI),
  or when the terminal does not reply.  Detection runs before
  prompt_toolkit's Application owns the tty.  New module `jarn.tui.termbg`
  exposes `parse_osc11`, `luminance`, and `detect` as public API.

- **`@git:` and `@url:` rich mentions (T-2-9)** — two new submit-time mention kinds
  that expand on Enter before the agent sees the message:
  - **`@git:status|diff|staged|log`** — replaced by a fenced `<git-mention>` block
    containing real git output.  Fixed read-only argv allowlist
    (`--porcelain=v1 -b`, `diff`, `diff --staged`, `log --oneline -15`), direct
    subprocess (no shell), 5 s timeout, cwd=project root, output tail-capped at
    2 000 chars and passed through the central `redact_secrets` helper.  Unknown
    subcommands (e.g. `@git:frobnicate`) are left verbatim.  Errors (not a repo,
    timeout) produce an error-annotated block instead of crashing the submit.
  - **`@url:<url>`** — pure text rewrite to
    `fetch <url> with web_fetch and use its content`; no pre-fetch (network stays
    agent-mediated and SSRF-guarded by the permission engine).
  Tab completion suggests the four `@git:` subcommands; `@url:` is freeform
  (registered in the resolver registry so it is not mis-routed to the file
  resolver, but returns no keystroke candidates).  Expansion runs in a single pass
  alongside paste-placeholder expansion at submit time.

- **Word-level (intraline) diff emphasis (T-2-8)** — edit-approval diffs now
  highlight the exact characters that changed within a modified line, not just
  colour the whole line red/green.  Adjacent equal-count runs of deleted/added
  lines are paired 1:1; each pair uses `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to locate
  changed spans and renders them with `bold reverse` emphasis on top of the
  existing red/green line colour.  Lines longer than 200 characters or with a
  similarity ratio below 0.3 fall back to plain line-level rendering to avoid
  noisy full-line reverse-video.  The `max_lines` cap and footer behaviour are
  unchanged.  Full syntax highlighting inside diffs was deliberately excluded
  (readability + YAGNI).

- **Shell-escape context injection (T-2-7)** — `! <cmd>` output is now captured and fed
  into the next agent turn's context as a fenced `<shell-escape context>` block so the
  agent sees what the user ran and what it returned. Capped at 50 lines / 2 000 chars
  (whichever is smaller), redacted for secrets, and cleared after the first use —
  multiple `!` commands accumulate oldest-first, and queued inputs receive the block
  too (they drain through the same enrichment path). Opt out with
  `execution.shell_escape_context: false`, also exposed in `/config` under **Behavior**.

- **Esc-Esc rewind chord + empty-Enter hint (T-2-6)** — two discoverability
  improvements to the inline REPL:
  - **Esc-Esc rewind chord:** press Esc twice within 500 ms while idle with an
    empty input buffer to open the `/rewind` picker (Claude Code muscle memory).
    The first Esc still clears non-empty input; a second Esc on an already-empty
    buffer fires the picker. Esc while busy or while a picker/overlay is open keeps
    its existing cancel semantics — the chord never fires in those states.
  - **Empty-Enter hint:** the first time you press Enter on an empty idle prompt,
    jarn prints a one-line discovery hint:
    `type a message · / commands · @ files · Esc Esc rewind`.
    Subsequent empty Enters are silent (hint shown once per session).

- **Fuzzy completion tier (T-2-5)** — the completion engine now uses a two-tier
  pipeline for `/command` names, `@file`/`@folder:`/`@symbol:` mentions, and
  command-argument values (e.g. `/model` refs).  Tier 1 is the existing
  prefix-match list (original order, behaviour unchanged).  Tier 2 appends
  fuzzy-subsequence matches not already in tier 1, ranked by a word-boundary
  (+3), adjacent-run (+1), gap-penalty (−0.1/char) scorer.  This means typos
  and abbreviations now resolve: `/cmit` → `/commit`, `@pyprjct` →
  `pyproject.toml`.  Stdlib-only; no new dependencies.  Public API:
  `fuzzy_rank(query, candidates) -> list[str]` in `jarn.tui.completion`.

- **Ghost autosuggest + Ctrl+R history picker (T-2-4)** — two fish/zsh-style history
  features for the inline REPL:
  - **Ghost autosuggest:** as you type, the most recent matching history entry appears
    as dim ghost text after the cursor (`AppendAutoSuggestion`). Press **→ (Right arrow)**
    or **Ctrl+E** at the end of the line to accept the full suggestion. Mid-line, Right
    arrow still moves the cursor normally. When the completion dropdown is open it wins
    over the ghost text (completion-menu-takes-precedence rule).
  - **Ctrl+R history picker:** opens an arrow-key overlay over the 50 most recent unique
    history entries (newest first, deduplicated by recency). Live type-to-filter with
    case-insensitive substring matching; the header shows `(n/total)` as you filter.
    Multiline entries display as first-line + `…` in the picker but prefill the **full**
    text. **Enter** prefills the input buffer without submitting; **Esc** cancels with
    input unchanged. Works while a turn is running (only edits the pending input, never
    interferes with an in-flight approval prompt).

- **Live in-place todo checklist (T-2-3)** — the `⏺ Todos` plan checklist now renders
  LIVE above the input and re-renders in place as the agent flips items (✔ done / ◐ in
  progress / ☐ pending), instead of appearing only after each turn finishes (Claude
  Code-style).  It refreshes the instant a `write_todos` tool call lands, streams the
  assistant's prose/reasoning directly below it, and is capped to 8 lines (completed
  items collapse to a `✔ N done` summary, overflow elides behind `… +N more`) so a long
  plan can't push the input off-screen.  The full checklist is still committed once to
  scrollback at turn end.

- **Terminal-title state via OSC 2 (T-2-2)** — jarn now updates the terminal tab title to
  reflect the current state: `jarn — <project>` (idle), `✳ jarn — <project>` (agent working),
  `⏸ jarn — <project>` (waiting for approval), and plain `jarn` on exit.  Titles are emitted
  via the standard `\x1b]2;…\x07` OSC 2 sequence and are silently suppressed when stdout is
  not a TTY or when `ui.terminal_title: false`.  New config key: `ui.terminal_title` (bool,
  default `true`), exposed in `/config` under the **Appearance** tab.

- **Turn-end + approval notifications (T-2-1)** — jarn now emits a terminal BEL (`\a`)
  when a long agent turn finishes (elapsed ≥ `ui.notify_min_secs`, default 10 s) or when
  an approval prompt is about to render.  New config keys in the `ui` section:
  - `ui.notify` — `off | bell | desktop | both` (default `bell`).  `desktop` fires a
    native OS notification via `osascript` (macOS) or `notify-send` (Linux); silently
    skipped when the binary is absent.  `both` emits bell + desktop.
  - `ui.notify_min_secs` — minimum elapsed seconds before a turn-end notification fires
    (default `10`; set to `0` to always notify; approval notifications always fire).
  Both keys are surfaced in `/config` under the **Appearance** tab.  Desktop notification
  bodies use fixed strings only — no user prompt content is ever included.

### Removed

- **`policy.profile` config key, `--profile` CLI flag, and `/profile` slash command removed
  (v0.6.0 promise fulfilled)** — the deprecated `policy.profile` YAML key, the `--profile`
  CLI flag (hidden alias of `--preset`), and the `/profile` command (deprecated alias of
  `/preset`) are gone.  A `UserWarning` is emitted on first load if a v1 config still
  contains `policy.profile`; the key is dropped and the session continues.  Use
  `jarn --preset NAME` / `/preset NAME` instead (same preset names).  `jarn --profile X`
  now fails fast with an error naming `--preset`.  Config version bumped to 2 (T-1-9).
- **`jarn doctor --json` no longer emits `policy_profile` / `effective_profile` keys** —
  these machine-readable fields were removed alongside the profile system (T-1-9).
  Consumers of the JSON output should use the `preset` key instead.

### Fixed

- **Single cancel message per turn (T-2-11)** — cancelling an agent turn (Esc / Ctrl+C)
  previously could print two stop messages: `interrupted` from `app.py` and `cancelled` from
  the renderer, depending on the cancel path.  The renderer is now the single owner: the
  asyncio `CancelledError` path in `repl/turn.py` now calls `renderer.cancel()` before
  re-raising, and `app.py` defers silently.  Exactly one `cancelled` line is printed per
  cancelled agent turn.

- **Blank-line rhythm in committed output (T-2-11)** — `_sep()` in `TurnRenderer` previously
  printed a blank line on every kind transition except consecutive tools, so a same-kind
  repeat (e.g. text→text) emitted a spurious extra blank.  `_sep()` now emits a single
  separator only when the committed kind actually changes (generalized from the old
  tool-only suppression); consecutive same-kind commits produce no extra blank.  This is
  safe because no production path commits same-kind text consecutively — the suppression
  only removes the spurious blank.

- **`palette.styled_fg` NO_COLOR tautology removed (T-2-11)** — the dead branch
  `return text if not bold else text` was replaced with `return text` and a clarifying
  comment.  Behaviour is unchanged (plain text, bold intent dropped), dead code is gone.

- **Paste placeholder format updated to `[Pasted text #N +L lines]` (T-2-11)** — the
  bracketed-paste collapse token now matches Claude Code's style
  (`[Pasted text #1 +12 lines]` instead of the old `[Pasted #1: 12 lines]`).  The
  format string and the `_expand_pastes` dict-lookup round-trip are updated together.

- **npm packages now ship `LICENSE`** — `npm/build-packages.mjs` now copies the repo
  `LICENSE` file into all four assembled packages (`jarn-cli` + three platform binaries).
  `jarn-cli/package.json` template updated to list `LICENSE` in `files` (T-1-9).
- **RELEASE.md post-release note now references "the latest CHANGELOG section"** rather
  than a hardcoded `§0.4.4` version anchor, so the checklist stays accurate after each
  release; added the missing v0.5.0 sign-off row to the QA table (T-1-9).
- **README-TH.md synced and doc-sync-enforced**: the Thai README's test count had gone
  stale twice this wave; `tests/test_doc_sync.py` now covers `README-TH.md` alongside
  README/CONTRIBUTING/RELEASE. Count re-synced, lint command updated to include
  `scripts/`, `/profile` table row removed (T-1-9).
- **REPL console width now tracks terminal resize** — the Rich `Console` width was
  computed once at startup and capped at 100 columns; after a terminal resize,
  committed scrollback (prose, tool lines, reasoning blocks) and the live markdown
  preview continued wrapping to the stale startup width while prompt_toolkit's own
  windows (toolbar, input) already recomputed per frame, causing visible disagreement.
  A new `_current_width()` helper (`min(shutil.get_terminal_size().columns, 100)`) is
  called at the top of every commit and live-render entry point
  (`_commit_text`, `_commit_reasoning`, `_flush_stable`, `on_tool`, `on_tool_end`,
  `on_notice`, `cancel` in `TurnRenderer`; `_render_stream_md` and `_render_dim_ansi`
  in `InlineApp`), setting `console.width` at render time without reconstructing the
  Console object. The live-region markdown cache key was updated to include the current
  width so a resize at constant source content re-renders at the new width (T-1-7).

- **`background_max_concurrent` now enforces the cap instead of warning** — previously,
  reaching the configured concurrent-process limit logged a one-time warning but still
  allowed new starts. `run_in_background` now returns a tool-level refusal string
  `"background slots full (N/N) — check or kill existing jobs (list_background, kill_background)"`
  and does **not** spawn the process, letting the model react gracefully. Slot count is
  measured after exited processes are swept, so naturally finished jobs free capacity
  automatically (T-1-5).
- **`background_max_lifetime_secs` now kills over-age processes instead of warning** —
  previously, exceeding the configured lifetime logged a one-time warning. Processes that
  outlive `background_max_lifetime_secs` are now terminated (SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation
  via the shared `terminate_process_group` helper) on the next
  `run_in_background` / `check_background` / `list_background` call. Killed processes
  appear in `check_background` and `list_background` output with the distinguishing note
  `"killed: exceeded max_lifetime_secs"` (T-1-5).
- **Per-process background log directories are now removed on prune and shutdown** —
  previously, `mkdtemp`-created log directories under `jarn-bg-*` were leaked for the
  lifetime of the host process. Each background process now owns its own temp directory,
  which is removed via `shutil.rmtree` when the process is pruned (exited entry swept
  from the registry) or when the session shuts down via the existing atexit hook (T-1-5).
- **Docker containers are now removed on interpreter exit, not just on `close()`** —
  previously, a crash or uncaught exception that bypassed `close()` left the session
  container running until the *next* session's anti-orphan reaper picked it up.
  `CancellableDockerSandbox._start()` now registers an `atexit` callback
  (`_atexit_cleanup`) immediately after the container starts; `close()` calls
  `atexit.unregister()` so a normally-closed session removes the entry cleanly.  The
  callback is idempotent and swallows all errors so it never aborts interpreter
  shutdown.  `__del__` and the pid-file reaper are retained as additional backstops
  (T-1-6).

- **ctx% gauge now tracks the latest main-model prompt, not the lifetime max** —
  `CostTracker.record()` previously used `max(context_tokens, input_tokens)`, so the
  gauge never dropped after summarization (T-1-1) shrunk the prompt. It now assigns
  `prompt_tokens = input_tokens + cache_read_tokens + cache_creation_tokens` (assignment,
  not max) and only updates the gauge for main-model calls (`is_main=True`). Subagent and
  summarizer traffic no longer inflates the ctx% gauge.
- **`_last_usage_totals` no longer leaks stale entries across thread churn** —
  `SessionDriver.run_turn()` previously used an inverted filter that kept OTHER threads'
  `(thread_id, model_ref)` keys forever after `/clear`, `/compact`, or `/rewind`. Replaced
  with `dict.clear()` so the dict is bounded to the keys added within the current turn.
  The cumulative-stream dedup is unaffected: it baselines from the first chunk of each
  new turn (no prior entry → delta = cumulative), which is correct for a fresh API call.
- **Silent auto-checkpoint failures now surface once per session** — a snapshot that
  raised was previously swallowed by `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` in
  `SessionDriver.run_turn()`, silently disabling `/undo` with no signal. A snapshot
  exception is now logged with a full traceback and surfaced as a single NOTICE —
  `checkpoint failed — /undo unavailable this turn (see ~/.jarn/logs/jarn.log)` — exactly
  once per session (a failure found during turn cleanup, e.g. on a no-mutation turn, is
  deferred to the start of the next turn). The turn is never aborted.
- **`/abort`, `/undo`, and `/redo` no longer race a still-building checkpoint snapshot** —
  after the non-blocking-snapshot change, a turn cancelled while its turn-start snapshot
  was still building (tree captured off `_checkpoint_lock`, not yet pushed) detached that
  snapshot fire-and-forget. An immediate `/abort` rollback (or a manual `/undo` right after
  an Esc-cancel) could take the lock first and pop the *previous* turn's checkpoint —
  reverting the working tree an extra turn back (over-revert) — while the late snapshot then
  pushed, leaving the stack out of sync with disk. A new `SessionDriver.settle_snapshot()`
  (awaited via `Controller.settle_snapshot()` before every UI-driven checkpoint-stack
  mutation) now waits for the pending and any detached snapshot to land first, so the
  rollback targets exactly the cancelled turn's start. Reachable only on large repos, where
  the snapshot is slow enough to still be in flight.

### Changed

- **Error classification is now type/status-code-first with heuristic fallback** —
  `classify_error(exc)` (new public function in `jarn.agent.stream_handlers`) replaces
  the two separate `_is_retryable_error` / `_is_auth_error` heuristic checks at the
  error-emission call site in `SessionDriver`. The new function walks `exc.__cause__` /
  `__context__` up to depth 5; for each exception it checks (a) `status_code` /
  `response.status_code` attributes (covers any SDK that exposes them), then (b) known
  typed exceptions (`httpx.TimeoutException`, `httpx.HTTPStatusError`,
  `asyncio.TimeoutError`, `ConnectionError`, `anthropic` / `openai` SDK classes —
  all import-guarded), and only falls through to the existing substring heuristic table
  when the chain is exhausted. A `classified_by: "type" | "heuristic"` key is attached
  to every `ERROR` event's `data` dict for observability. `_is_retryable_error` and
  `_is_auth_error` are kept as thin delegating wrappers for backward compatibility (T-1-8).

- **Auto-checkpoint snapshots no longer block turn start** — `SessionDriver.run_turn()`
  previously ran `checkpoint.snapshot()` (git `add -A` → write-tree, O(repo)) synchronously
  before the model was even called. The snapshot now starts in a worker thread
  (`asyncio.to_thread`) concurrently with the model call and is awaited only at the first
  mutation gate — where an approved/auto-approved `write_file`/`edit_file`/`execute` (or a
  `run_in_background` start) is about to execute — so no mutating tool ever runs against an
  uncaptured tree while turn start stays responsive. The task is reaped at turn end and
  detached to finish fire-and-forget (never leaked, never blocking) on a cancelled turn.
- **`verify.gate` now runs once per turn, not once per file edit** — previously
  `verify_after_edit` was invoked on every `write_file`/`edit_file` `TOOL_END`,
  running the detected test suite once per file in a multi-edit turn. It is now
  debounced: each edit marks a dirty flag, and a single verify call fires after the
  final `astream` iteration (when no pending interrupts remain). Cancelled turns
  (`asyncio.CancelledError`) and `/abort` naturally skip verify because they
  propagate past the completion branch. Mode semantics are unchanged: `suggest`
  emits one suggestion notice per turn; `auto` runs the command once per turn.
- **Unified auto-compaction into one summarization path** — previously two systems
  compacted at ~85%: deepagents' in-graph `SummarizationMiddleware` (main model, fixed
  trigger) and JARN's controller trigger (summarizer model, `context.compact_at_pct`,
  forked the thread). Now the built-in is excluded and replaced with a single in-graph
  instance on the resolved `routing.summarizer` model; the controller's auto-compact
  trigger is removed. `routing.summarizer` now actually drives automatic summarization,
  and `context.auto_compact: false` disables automatic summarization entirely. Manual
  `/compact` (summarize + continue in a fresh thread) is unchanged.
- **`context.compact_at_pct` now actually bites** — the trigger is resolved to an
  absolute token count from the **main** model's context window using JARN's own window
  table (the ctx% gauge's source), instead of deepagents' fraction trigger (which it
  resolved against the *summarizer* model and which silently degraded to a fixed 170k
  tokens for models without a LangChain profile — e.g. JARN's OpenRouter defaults —
  making the setting inert). When JARN can't size the main model, it falls back to the
  170k default and `/compact status` says so, plainly stating the setting has no effect
  until the window is known.
- **General-purpose subagent keeps summarization** — the model-keyed exclusion of the
  built-in middleware also stripped it from the auto-added `general-purpose` subagent
  (same model), so long `task()` delegations could hard-fail on context overflow. JARN's
  replacement is now injected through the harness profile's `extra_middleware`, which
  covers the main agent, the GP subagent, and same-model declarative subagents alike —
  restoring the `ContextOverflowError`→summarize recovery on delegated work.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Headless multi-turn** — `jarn -p` honors `--max-turns`; `--resume-session` continues a
  prior thread; JSON output includes `tool_calls` and structured `{error: {kind, message}}`;
  exit codes `0`/`1`/`2`/`124`.
- **Context token budgets** — `context.memory_tokens`, `wiki_index_tokens`, and
  `project_context_tokens` cap injected prompt size with truncation notices.
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** — `observability.tracing.backend: langsmith | otel`
  (default `langsmith`); optional `jarn[otel]` extra exports spans via OTLP
  (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).
- **Image paste** — Linux (Wayland/X11), Windows, and macOS clipboard support with
  format fallbacks and a size cap.
- **Arg-aware slash completion** — `/model`, `/preset`, `/mode`, `/resume`, `/mcp`, and
  related commands complete arguments after the command name.
- **Verify gate** — `verify.gate: suggest | auto` surfaces or runs detected test commands
  after edits.
- **`/telemetry status`** — audit local telemetry storage (path, size, event count).
- **MCP per-server timeout** and `/mcp status --refresh` health re-check.
- **Pricing network opt-out** — `pricing.network: false` / `JARN_NO_NETWORK_PRICING=1`
  skips the OpenRouter startup fetch.
- **CI hardening** — release preflight gates, coverage floor (74%), `scripts/` lint,
  Windows matrix, `pip-audit` + gitleaks security job, Dependabot, nightly eval workflow.
- **Doc-sync test** — README/CONTRIBUTING/RELEASE test counts enforced against pytest collection.
- **Pydantic config validation** with `config_version` and a v0→v1 migrator.

### Changed

- `/compact status` shows auto-compact settings; bare `/compact` runs interactive compaction.
- `/cost` shows per-source context injection sizes vs configured budgets.
- Cost attribution splits evenly across parallel tool calls in a turn; streaming usage
  deduplicates cumulative provider chunks.
- Doctor skill shadowing matches runtime (`.jarn` wins over `.claude`).
- **`policy.profile` / `--profile` / `/profile`** deprecated with removal planned in
  **v0.6.0** — use `--preset` / `/preset` instead.
- Untrusted project config uses an allowlist — `routing`, `budget`, `wiki`, and related
  keys require `jarn trust` before they take effect.
- Hook subprocesses inherit a minimal env allowlist by default (`hooks.inherit_env: true`
  restores the old behavior).
- The `ci` preset requires the Docker execution backend (fail-closed on hosts without Docker).
- SWE-bench Modal A/B script moved to `contrib/` (research tooling, not shipped).
- Internal refactor: `repl`, `controller`, `session`, and `builder` split into packages;
  unified slash-command registry drives dispatch and `/help`.

### Removed

- Unused `pytest-textual-snapshot` dev dependency.
- Dead code: `MemoryStore._` placeholder field, unused `JarnRuntime.warnings`,
  duplicate `skill_dirs()` helper, unused splash `model`/`mode` params,
  duplicate `DANGEROUS_COMMAND_HINTS` in defaults.

### Fixed

- `/clear` clears terminal scrollback and resets the live region.
- Checkpoint undo rolls back orphan redo entries on apply failure; file lock for concurrent undo.
- Background job log FD leak; exited processes pruned from registry.
- Repomap xref build linearized; `build_repo_map` shares discovery TTL cache.
- Model factory cache invalidated on `/key` and config reload; `SecretResolutionError` propagates.
- `verify.py` fewer false positives (pytest/ruff only when configured; better Node/Makefile detection).
- `/review` includes untracked new files.
- Checkpoint lock file lives under ``.git/`` so duplicate snapshots deduplicate correctly.
- Corrupt YAML no longer wipes `config.yaml` or rule stores — fail-closed with `.bak` backup.
- Scope checks resolve paths against `project_root`, not process CWD; symlink escapes rejected.
- Central secret redaction across transcripts, logs, and error messages.
- CI: skip ``mypy`` on Windows runners; upgrade deps to clear ``pip-audit`` findings.

### Security

- Danger-guard expanded (installers, `docker run --privileged`, mass git discard, homoglyphs);
  honest limits documented in SECURITY.md.
- Inline plaintext API keys warn at load (`strict_secrets: true` rejects).
- Provider `extra` kwargs restricted to per-provider allowlists; MCP/subagent URLs validated at load.
- Secret-file tree permissions tightened; keychain account validation on read path.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **npm distribution (`jarn-cli`)** — install the standalone binary with
  `npm install -g jarn-cli` (exposes both `jarn` and `jarn-cli`); **no Python
  required**. Ships as a small launcher package plus per-platform binary packages
  (`jarn-cli-linux-x64`, `-linux-arm64`, `-darwin-arm64`) selected automatically
  through npm `os`/`cpu` — no install scripts, so it works under `--ignore-scripts`.
  The release workflow builds the three binaries and publishes them to npm
  alongside the PyPI release, version-locked to the same git tag.

### Changed

- The release builds **Linux arm64** binaries (added to the existing Linux x64 and
  macOS arm64). **Intel macOS (x86_64) is no longer built** — GitHub's last Intel
  runner (`macos-13`) is being deprecated and its queue is unreliable; Intel mac
  users install via `pip install jarn`.

### Fixed

- npm publish in CI: the job now reads `NPM_TOKEN` from its deployment environment
  (it previously had no `environment:`, so the token was empty → `ENEEDAUTH`), and
  publishes **without `--provenance`** (provenance requires a public source repo;
  this one is private until launch). The PyPI publish gained `skip-existing` so
  re-runs are no-ops. These were the issues behind the 0.4.2/0.4.3 npm failures.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-18

Packaging-only interim (PyPI). The npm publish failed (provenance is unsupported
for private repos); npm ships in 0.4.4.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-18

Packaging-only interim (PyPI). The npm publish failed (the job had no deployment
environment, so the token was empty); npm ships in 0.4.4.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-18

Packaging-only interim release (PyPI). Adds the npm packaging groundwork — the
`jarn-cli` launcher, per-platform packaging, and release automation — but the
first npm publish ships in 0.4.3.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-18

A customer-feedback remediation pass (19 tasks across onboarding, permissions,
approvals, cost/context surfacing, and docs) plus follow-up fixes, then a
competitive-gaps round closing five user pain points versus other harnesses:
prompt caching, plan-mode handoff, `/commit` + `/review`, background processes,
and macOS image paste; then a UX-polish round (16 fixes from an end-to-end
user-journey audit) covering live in-place streaming, onboarding key capture,
in-session auth recovery, faster approvals, cache-aware cost, suggested memory,
rich `@`-mentions, and conversation rewind. A multi-agent review then hardened the
round — fixing a `/rewind` blocker (rewind to the first turn), a cached-token cost
double-count, a per-keystroke `@symbol` stall, and a reasoning-render regression —
and dogfooding against a real LM Studio model surfaced two more: the unpriced-model
notice is now logged (not leaked to the TUI), setup validation shows a spinner +
timeout and is skippable (a cold local model no longer looks like a hang), and token
usage is now tracked for OpenAI-compatible streaming (LM Studio / vLLM). Test count:
789 → 1166.

### Added

- **`/rewind` — branch the conversation to an earlier turn** — pick an earlier
  user turn (arrow-key picker), optionally edit that turn's prompt, and continue
  from there. The rewind *forks* onto a new thread (via the same messages-reducer
  mechanism `/compact` uses), so the original session stays intact and resumable
  in `/resume` — nothing is destroyed. First slice rewinds the **conversation
  only**: file edits made after the chosen turn are **not** reverted; the picker
  and the post-rewind notice point at `/undo` for those. Linking the rewind to the
  git-checkpoint stack so file edits revert atomically is a deferred slice.
- **Live in-place markdown streaming** — assistant output renders as one growing
  *formatted* block in the input region and commits to scrollback once per prose
  run, instead of streaming as dim raw markdown that re-rendered paragraph by
  paragraph. Removes the double-echo flicker, the 8-line preview clip, and literal
  mid-construct markup (open code fences, tables).
- **Core-loop polish** — one-key accept/deny in the approval menu; reasoning text
  streams live during a thinking phase; a steady thinking-word indicator; queued
  input echoes once (not twice); `@file` completion no longer rescans the directory
  on every keystroke; Esc-cancel now states that file edits remain and points at
  rollback (`/abort`).
- **Onboarding that secures a usable key** — the TUI setup wizard now detects an
  existing `*_API_KEY` in your environment, tags a recommended provider, offers a
  model pick-list with a custom-entry fallback for cloud providers, nudges when a
  local endpoint (Ollama / LM Studio) is unreachable, and prompts for/validates a
  key before finishing so the first turn works.
- **In-session auth recovery** — an invalid/expired key now surfaces a friendly
  "key rejected (401) — fix with /key, jarn setup, or your env var" message instead
  of raw SDK JSON; **`/key`** sets or replaces the current provider's key (keychain)
  and rebuilds the runtime without restarting; an auth failure now rotates to a
  configured `routing.fallback` provider instead of dead-ending.
- **Cache-aware cost** — prompt-cache read/write tokens are tracked and shown in
  `/cost` (cloud cache pricing where known); totals still reconcile when a turn has
  no cache usage.
- **Suggested memory** — the agent can propose a memory the user approves
  (`y / N / edit`) before it is written via the existing store (tier + trust gated).
- **Rich `@`-mentions (first slice)** — `@folder` and `@symbol` resolve alongside
  `@path` through an extensible resolver registry; `@url` / `@docs` are deferred.
- **Image paste (macOS)** — **Ctrl+V** grabs a screenshot/image from the clipboard,
  saves it under `.jarn/pastes/`, and inserts it as an `@path` so the agent's
  multimodal `read_file` loads it on send — no more save-to-disk-then-type-the-path.
  Uses `pngpaste` if installed, else an AppleScript fallback; degrades to a hint on
  other platforms or an empty clipboard.
- **Background processes** — `run_in_background` / `check_background` /
  `kill_background` / `list_background` tools let the agent start a dev server,
  watcher, or long build and keep working instead of blocking on output (the
  ordinary `execute` blocks with a 120s timeout). Output streams to a per-process
  log; `/ps` lists them and `/ps kill <id>` stops one. Gated like shell (the
  danger-guard inspects the command); local backend only (`execution.background`,
  default on) — not registered under docker/sandbox; all terminated on exit.
- **Plan-mode handoff** — in read-only `plan` mode the agent now researches, then
  calls a new `exit_plan_mode` tool to present a concrete plan. You approve it
  (arrow-key picker: proceed in auto-edit / proceed asking / keep planning) and the
  session escalates the permission mode and carries the plan out *in the same turn*
  — no manual `/mode` switch and re-prompt. Untrusted projects stay clamped to the
  review-only floor (`/trust` to lift). Default landing mode: `plan.exit_mode`.
- **`/commit` and `/review`** — `/commit` gathers the working-tree diff, has the
  agent draft a conventional commit message, and runs `git commit` (through the
  normal approval path; nothing is pushed). `/review` seeds a read-only review of
  the current diff for correctness bugs and quality. Both embed the diff in the
  seeded turn so the agent skips a tool round-trip.
- **Local prompt-cache keep-warm (`routing.prompt_cache: auto`, default on)** —
  cloud caching is already automatic (the agent engine adds Anthropic cache-control;
  other cloud providers cache by prefix server-side). What was missing was the local
  side: `routing.keep_alive` now keeps an Ollama / LM Studio model + its KV/prefix
  cache resident between turns (Ollama `keep_alive` / LM Studio request `ttl`), so a
  local model doesn't unload on idle and recompute the whole prompt next turn. Cuts
  cost and first-token latency on repeated context.
- **Current-date awareness** — the assembled system prompt states the local
  date/time, so time-sensitive requests ("find today's news") are no longer
  anchored to the model's training cutoff.
- **Context-% gauge for local models** — the toolbar `ctx N%` gauge resolves the
  window for LM Studio (`/api/v0/models`) and Ollama (`/api/show`), so it shows
  for local models, not only curated cloud ones.
- **Live token/throughput while generating** — the spinner/stream footer shows
  the prompt size while processing, then output tokens + a real tok/s rate while
  generating (estimated from the streamed text when the provider streams without
  per-chunk usage, e.g. LM Studio).
- **`/doctor` in the REPL** (same checks as `jarn doctor`, inline); **`/memory
  dump`** (one "what the agent knows" view); **`/abort`** (cancel the turn and
  roll back its edits); **`/preset`** / `--preset` (canonical mode+sandbox
  shortcut).
- **Approvals**: `[v]` view-full-diff through the pager and `[e]`
  edit-before-apply in the menu; **`/compact` preview + confirm**;
  `ui.approval_diff_lines` makes the inline diff cap configurable.
- **Onboarding**: env-key detection + recommended provider + cloud/local/custom
  hints in the wizard; model-slug "did you mean"; local-model discovery (Ollama /
  LM Studio); a one-time unpriced-model warning.
- **Surfacing**: per-tool cost breakdown in `/cost`; web-search source hosts
  inline; grouped `/help` + toolbar glyph legend; always-visible trust indicator;
  `ui.splash: full|compact|off`.

### Changed

- **Unified permission model (P3.A)** — `permission_mode` + `policy.profile`
  collapse into one model: **Mode** (`/mode`), **Sandbox** (`/sandbox`), **Trust**
  (`/trust`), and **Presets** as launch-time shortcuts. `/profile`, `--profile`,
  and `policy.profile` are deprecated aliases of `/preset`/`--preset` (still work,
  with a one-time notice). The untrusted floor is now a direct clamp,
  byte-for-byte equivalent to the old `review-only` floor (pinned by an
  equivalence test). `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` rewritten around the one model.
- Entering **yolo** prints a prominent confirmation banner; `/undo` /`/redo` give
  an actionable message when autocheckpoint is off.

### Fixed

- **Multiple subagent interrupts** — resuming more than one pending HITL interrupt
  is keyed by interrupt id (LangGraph 1.x requirement), fixing the "you must
  specify the interrupt id when resuming" error when several subagents need
  approval at once.
- **Rapid Shift+Tab → yolo** no longer stacks confirmation prompts that fight over
  the input and hang.
- A mid-turn failure now logs the **full traceback** to `~/.jarn/logs/jarn.log`
  instead of showing only a one-line message.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-09

Still **alpha** (`Development Status :: 3 - Alpha`). v1.0.0 is not yet earned —
the road to 1.0 still wants broader real-world isolation testing, an MCP HTTP
hardening pass, and a longer-lived eval baseline. This release ships the
M1–M4 work below.

### Added

- **M1 — Docker container execution backend** (`execution.backend: docker`):
  every shell command and filesystem mutation runs inside a Docker container
  whose only window onto the host is a bind-mount of the project root. Resource
  limits (`docker_memory`, `docker_pids`, `docker_cpus`), non-root `docker_user`,
  `--network none` when network is denied, image preflight with a clear
  `SandboxUnavailable` error, and deterministic container teardown on close.
  An OS-level sandbox (`execution.local_sandbox`) remains the recommended default
  where Docker is unavailable.
- **M2 — Policy profiles + untrusted floor** (`policy.profile`, `--profile`,
  `/profile`): named bundles (`trusted-repo`, `review-only`, `sandbox-required`,
  `ci`, `offline`) that set permission mode, OS-sandbox mode, sandbox network,
  and whether web tools are registered. An untrusted project is one-way clamped
  to the `review-only` floor across **every** surface (TUI launch, `/mode`,
  Shift+Tab, the mode picker, `/sandbox`, headless `--permission-mode`).
- **M3 — Smoke-eval harness** (`scripts/eval.py`, `evals/`): discovers fixtures,
  drives one headless agent session per fixture against a throwaway repo copy,
  restores protected test files before scoring (anti-gaming), and detects
  regressions against a baseline. Not run in CI; costs real tokens.
- **M4 — `/mcp status`**: lists configured MCP servers with per-server health and
  last error (`No MCP servers configured.` when none).
- **M4 — `/trust` + untrusted launch notice**: `/trust` persists trust for the
  current project, lifts the review-only floor in-session, and rebuilds; the REPL
  surfaces a one-time scrollback notice when launched on an untrusted project.
- **`/config` — friendly interactive settings panel + scriptable get/set**:
  `/config` opens a **tabbed arrow-key panel** (Claude-Code style). Settings are
  grouped into plain-language categories (**←/→**: Models · Safety · Sandbox ·
  Budget · Behavior · Appearance), each shown with a **human label** (e.g. "Run
  commands in", "Auto-checkpoint") not the raw key; **↑/↓** select within a tab.
  **Enter** toggles a bool (`● On` / `○ Off`), cycles an enum, or edits a
  text/number in place (type · Enter saves · Esc cancels). A detail box explains
  the **selected** setting (its description + how to change it) so the screen
  stays uncluttered. `/config get <key>` / `/config set <key> <value>` remain for
  scripting. Every change coerces + validates the value, **persists it
  to `~/.jarn/config.yaml`** (comment-preserving ruamel round-trip, atomic), rolls
  back on an invalid value, and applies live. A curated scalar allowlist (mode,
  models, profile, execution, budget, context, ui, features) — structured /
  capability sections stay file/wizard-only. Untrusted sessions still clamp to the
  review-only floor even when a permissive mode is persisted.
- **`/config` cross-setting consistency checks.** Saving a setting now validates
  the *combination*, not just the value. Genuine contradictions are refused with
  a plain-language reason — e.g. enabling the OS sandbox
  (`execution.local_sandbox`) while the backend isn't `local` (the only backend
  that honours it) — but only when the edit *introduces* the conflict, so a
  pre-existing hand-edited config never blocks an unrelated change. Harmless
  "this knob has no effect right now" cases (a budget threshold with no budget,
  a compact-% with auto-compact off, a value a policy profile will overwrite at
  launch) are saved with a ⚠ note instead of being blocked.

### Security / hardening

- **Docker in-container cancellation now actually kills the process tree.** The
  exec id is embedded in the shell command's argv (a `: JARN_EXEC_ID=<id> ;`
  no-op prefix) so `pkill -f JARN_EXEC_ID=<id>` reliably matches and kills the
  cancelled exec — replacing the prior env-var marker that `pkill -f` never
  matched. The default image is now non-slim `python:3.12` (ships `procps`/`pkill`).
- **Anti-orphan reaper is session-scoped.** Containers carry a per-session
  `jarn-session=<uuid>` label and a pid-file under `~/.jarn/run/`; the reaper only
  removes containers whose owning process is dead, so a concurrent jarn session in
  a sibling process is never destroyed.
- **Web-tools SSRF guard closes a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU.** `_check_host` now
  resolves DNS exactly once and returns the validated IPs, which are pinned at
  connect-time — eliminating the second lookup an attacker could rebind.
  `web_search` now routes through that same guarded, IP-pinned, manual-redirect
  path (previously it used `httpx` auto-redirects with no SSRF check).
- **Eval checker injection closed.** Fixture `checker` strings are validated
  against an allowlist (`python`/`python3`/`pytest`, no shell metacharacters) and
  run with `shell=False`; the eval agent loads an eval-neutral config (no dev-repo
  context/keys bleed into fixture runs).
- **Transcript secret redaction.** User prompts and assistant replies are scrubbed
  of common secret shapes (vendor key prefixes, `NAME=secret` assignments) before
  being persisted to the on-disk JSONL transcript.
- Trust dialog now labels `policy` and `observability` as gated keys.

### Changed

- Default Docker image: `python:3.12-slim` → `python:3.12` (procps/pkill present).
- `!` shell escape is now visually distinct: the input line renders **red + bold**
  while typing, the echoed command shows a red `!` + `(host shell)` marker, and a
  `⚡ host shell — runs on your machine directly; no agent, no approval` header
  precedes its output — so it's unmistakable that it bypasses the agent.
- Version → 0.3.0; classifier stays `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha`.

### Fixed

- **Large write/edit approvals no longer flood the terminal.** The unified diff
  shown before approving a `write_file` / `edit_file` is capped (40 lines) with
  the remainder collapsed to a `… (+N more lines)` footer, so creating or
  rewriting a big file no longer dumps the whole content into the prompt.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md interop** — auto-loads the first present of
  `compat.context_files` (default order: `JARN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`);
  skills and commands are also discovered under `.claude/` dirs
  (`compat.read_claude_dir`, default `true`); `.jarn` always wins on conflict
- **Headless one-shot mode** — `jarn -p "prompt"` (also `--print`) for non-interactive
  use; reads prompt from stdin with `-`; flags `--json`, `--model`,
  `--permission-mode`, `--max-turns`, `--cwd`; fail-closed (gated tools are refused,
  never silently approved, unless an auto-approving mode is set)
- **JSONL session transcript** — append-only log at
  `<project>/.jarn/sessions/<id>.jsonl`; one line per user/assistant/tool event;
  grepping- and git-friendly; configurable via `observability.transcript` (default
  `true`)
- **`!` shell escape** — a REPL line starting with `!` runs a shell command directly
  (no agent, no tokens, no approval prompt)
- **OS-level execution sandbox** — kernel-enforced isolation beneath the danger-guard:
  `sandbox-exec` / SBPL on macOS, `bwrap` on Linux; config keys
  `execution.local_sandbox` (`off` | `auto` | `require`, default `off`),
  `execution.sandbox_allow_network` (default `true`),
  `execution.sandbox_writable` (extra writable paths)
- **Auto-checkpoint + `/undo` / `/redo` / `/checkpoints`** — snapshots the working
  tree before each turn so edits are fully reversible; config `git.autocheckpoint`
  (default `false`), `git.checkpoint_mode` (`shadow` | `commit`, default `shadow`);
  snapshots use private refs and never move HEAD, the branch, or the staged index
- **Repo map** — ranked, token-budgeted codebase overview built with stdlib `ast` +
  light regex for JS/TS/Go/Rust (no extra dependencies); `repo_map` tool +
  `/map [focus] [--refresh]` command; config `context.repo_map` (`off` | `tool` |
  `auto`, default `tool`), `context.repo_map_tokens` (default 1024)
- **Wiki knowledge base** — grep-readable markdown KB at `~/.jarn/wiki` and
  `<project>/.jarn/wiki`; tools `wiki_search` / `wiki_read` (read-only) and
  `wiki_write` / `wiki_append` (gated as WRITE); `/wiki` command; config
  `wiki.enabled` (default `false`); index injected into the prompt; project-tier
  gated by trust

### Security

- `compat` config settings are now actually honored at runtime (previously loaded
  but not applied)
- OS sandbox path-injection guard prevents crafted paths from escaping the sandbox
  root
- `observability` section is now trust-gated — a project config can no longer
  silently enable LangSmith tracing or change the log level
- Untrusted-project wiki pages are not readable by tools (consistent with the
  existing trust gate on project memory and `JARN.md`)
- Transcript tool-argument entries are size-capped to prevent disk exhaustion from
  large tool payloads
- `execution.backend` and `observability.log_level` values are now validated on
  load; invalid values raise `ConfigError` immediately

### Fixed

- `jarn doctor` now reports autocheckpoint, wiki, transcript, and repo_map status
  alongside the existing provider and extension checks

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

First public **alpha** release on PyPI. Terminal-first coding agent harness on
[DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) / LangGraph.

### Added

- Terminal REPL (`jarn`) with native scrollback, streaming Markdown, tool log,
  inline approvals, adaptive toolbar, and input queue
- Permission engine (plan / ask / auto-edit / yolo) with danger-guard, interrupt →
  approval flow, and persisted allow rules
- Project trust boundary — untrusted `.jarn/config.yaml` capability keys stripped
  until explicitly trusted (`jarn trust`)
- Multi-provider BYO key routing, fallback chain, live cost/budget tracking
- Skills, custom slash commands, subagents, lifecycle hooks, MCP client
- Long-term memory (global + project) with recall and `/memory` CRUD/search
- Resumable sessions (SQLite checkpointer), `/resume` picker, session titles
- `jarn setup`, `jarn doctor` (with extension diagnostics), `jarn init`, `jarn trust`
- Slash-command completion with descriptions; `/help` registry
- 371 automated tests (including packaging gate); CI: ruff, mypy, pytest, wheel smoke

### Security

- SSRF guards on `web_fetch`, cancellable shell, sandbox fail-closed default
- Async-subagent tool gating and ambient LangGraph key leak detection
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and reporting

### Known limitations (alpha)

- Runs on the **host filesystem** by default — not a sandboxed VM
- Live model calls require your own API key; CI does not exercise real LLM traffic
- Windows: use WSL; native Windows terminal is unsupported
- Web UI, hosted sandbox, and other post-launch differentiators are not in this release
